        tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the solution.\n
        • Each guess is a calculation.\n
        • You can use 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 + - * / or =.\n
        • It must contain one “=”.\n
        • It must only have a number to the right of the “=”, not another calculation.\n
        • It must only have a operator to the left of the “=”, not another calculation.\n
        • If the answer is 10+20=30, then it only accepts 10+20=30.\n
